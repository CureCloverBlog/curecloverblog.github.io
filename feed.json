I think all of them stem from the main one - the plot. Time travel to change and then prevent changed past as well as court hearing that examines character's past are an overused tools of TV shows. Tools to make easy filler episodes. They never move the story forward and are just a side steps with many \"what ifs\". And the play's story never moves, it's just old characters reliving past events. And this is why it feels like a bad fanfic - many fanfic authors reuse old plot points ad naseum. Stories progress only when new things happen, not when old stuff is relived and is allowed to proceed.</p>\n<p>And it seems that story was constructed to produce as many twists and cheap thrills as possible using easiest writer tool. An emotional part of the ending was nice, but I would be glad if the same conclusion was reached with, you know, actual original story. How about actually seeing what the future ministry and Hogwarts are like? New policies at the ministry? New teachers and classes at Hogwarts for example? We never got to see anything about them, because we were stuck in the past reliving the same plot lines which were resolved nicely in the books!</p>\n<p>I don't know how many times Voldemort needs to be resurrected, to be honest. We don't really need him as a super villain anymore! Couldn't Jo just leave the whole Voldemort thing out, as it's over and done with, and create a new villain brewing from the darkness? Dumbledore defeated the previous super villain, Grindelwald and that was that. He died and stayed dead. Instead of going back and bringing up old villains that have already been dealt with which brings the plot nowhere. There is almost no character growth whatsoever. It's just a load of action and OMG revelation moments that don't really add to the depth of the established canon.</p>\n<p>I would've been happy to watch a play about middle aged Ron, Harry and Hermione grappling with middle age problems while a new species of evil lurks somewhere while following the adventures of Scorpius, Rose and Albus. Something like that could've even spawned a new series which focuses on new but still relevant characters without rewriting anything about the old characters.</p>\n<p>Another thing I want to point out though is why I think it reads like bad fanfiction: it's not just the plot points, it's how characters talk about past events that bugs me. It's like they've all read the Harry Potter books and know the summaries of them, not like they are in the world within those books. That's what bad fanfic writers do, because they are readers of the HP series, and thus know greater detail about the world and characters (and HP fans) than the characters themselves can know.</p>\n<p>For example, Scorpius and Albus know so much about Cedric's every move from the Triwizard Tournament, more than I'd expect them to know just from passing stories from their parents. Why would they know all of that? Also, when they are talking about why Ron and Hermione don't get together in the messed up timeline, why do they know so much about the dating lives of Albus' uncle and aunt? Like, I can imagine Ron and Hermione reminiscing about Yule Ball with their own kids, but would they tell details about who was dating whom and boring teen drama that happened decades ago? It just seemed like every time one of the children talked about past events or met characters from that time period, they knew too much about it, like they had read the HP series for a history class or something. And they treat intimate details about the original characters like common knowledge, with no room for the new characters' discoveries or perspectives.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27o\">Time Turner Plot Holes</h1>\n<p>1) In Prisoner of Azkaban the time travel was perfect. There's a single timeline and when Hermione or Harry and Hermione go back in time they join the past - i.e. what they do has already happened, and in fact Harry comments at one point that he knows it happened because he saw it happened. This is how single-timeline time travel works. Going back in time doesn't alter the past, present, or future because what you do has already happened.</p>\n<p>Then in the Cursed Child they decide that going back in time does change the past, either because the playwright apparently didn't understand the brilliant time travel in Prisoner of Azkaban, or he didn't care. So suddenly we go from single-timeline time travel to multiple-timeline time travel, a la The Butterfly Effect, which by the way means that they never go back to the original timeline.</p>\n<p>2) On Pottermore it was stated that you could go back 5 hours with the old Time Turners. If you tried to go back further, it would result in the death of the user and people being unborn. This also explained why nobody could go back in time and kill Voldemort when he was a child for example. Now with the new Time Turner existing, everyone is going to point this out once again. The trials Harry went through can just be undone. Also with the new Time Turner you can go back as far as you want and it isn’t single-timeline travel anymore. It’s not possible that two different time travel methods exist in one universe (single-timeline travel and multiple timelines/Butterfly effect).</p>\n<p>3) Surprise! Yes, the Time-Turners were all destroyed, but what if – gasp! – the baddies made a new one?! The ministry of magic must have spent tons of time developing the Time Turner of Prisoner of Azkaban in the Department of Mysteries. How can one guy, all on his own, develop a ‘better’ Time Turner without the people and the resources from the ministry to help him?</p>\n<p>4) Draco: \"oh look, I had a time turner the whole time and it's an even better version. How convenient!” It’s a deus ex machina that he conveniently had a perfect version of the Time Turner at the end. Why not use it earlier to go back in time and take the 5-minute Time Turner from Albus and Scorpius?</p>\n<p>5) The idea that Scorpius and Albus can do their thing with burning holes in the blanket and Harry will see it in the future and be able to travel back in time before Delphi makes her move on Voldemort doesn't make sense. Time travel logic doesn't work like that, not even through magic. Whatever Delphi did would have also taken effect in the future where Harry sees the writing on the blanket.</p>\n<p>6) EVEN IF HARRY HAD DIED AND VOLDEMORT HAD WON THE BATTLE OF HOGWARTS SNAPE WOULD BE DEAD! Voldemort killed Snape because he was convinced that the Elder Wand answered to him after killing Dumbledore. Neville's dying did not change the wand's alliance to Voldemort, and Harry would have died after Snape regardless, as per Deathly Hallows' normal timeline. The only thing that changed in the \"Voldemort and Valor\" universe is that Neville didn't kill Nagini, but Nagini kills Snape prior to when her death is supposed to happen, so Snape should have died anyway.</p>\n<p>7) If Voldemort killed Harry in the darkest timeline, he would’ve had to kill Harry at least twice, because Harry is protected by his mother’s sacrifice which also lingers in Voldemort because he used Harry’s blood. Harry would’ve come back to life the first time.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27p\">Major plot holes</h1>\n<p>1) How is Harry's scar even hurting him?! The horcrux inside him was destroyed?! So shouldn't that not even be a remote possibility?! Why was Harry able to speak Parseltongue again? He could only speak it because a part of Voldemort lived in him. And the explanation at the end of the play is bullshit. “I needed to get rid of Voldemort mentally”. He already did! The piece of soul of Voldemort isn’t something physical, it’s something mental that defines you. The only reason these things happened was for the plot.</p>\n<p>2) Why are the werewolves and giants on the move? What were they doing? Apparently this is because of Delphi, because the giants have wing tattoos on their backs. But Delphi never does anything with them and it remains unexplained. Btw, how did Delphi put a tattoo on those giants’ backs?</p>\n<p>3) The trolley witch being some kind of veela monster and growing spikes from her hands? Being over 200 years old? Exploding candy? All the people who have accidentally dropped their Pumpkin Pasty and it exploded on them, rest in peace. She was just a nice lady selling sweets on the train.</p>\n<p>4) TROLLEY WITCH: “Never — never — have I let anyone off this train before they reached their destination.” I guess she's forgetting about Harry's seventh year when multiple students were taken off the Hogwarts Express. What about preventing the dementors from boarding the train in book 3?</p>\n<p>5) And why are the only people who have attempted to get off the train people we know? (Sirius, James etc.) Couldn’t some unknown student have tried as well? Anyway, Sirius and James are talented Animagi and Fred and George are smart as well. If they didn’t manage to get off the train, why do Albus and Scorpius manage it by simply jumping off?</p>\n<p>6) When they had the bit about Lily taking Harry out in the pram I was like \"Wait, what?\" What about the Fidelius Charm?? They were in hiding! It would have been dangerous to do that and then anyone could attack them!</p>\n<p>7) There is no way Albus and Scorpius (or any character except perhaps Harry) would have been able to see James and Lily's house, and James and Lily couldn't have taken a walk. They were under the Fidelius Charm at that time- they could not leave and the house could not be seen, and as both Peter and Sirius are long dead before Scorpius and Albus are born, there is no way in any world that they would be able to perceive the Potter house in Godric's Hollow. We hear about how frustrated James was about being \"cooped up\" in the series so it's pretty clear he couldn't just take walks. And with all of that, they definitely would not be able to break in to get the blanket.</p>\n<p>8) Albus talks about brewing up some Polyjuice Potion because Bathilda Bagshot probably has the ingredients...? It takes a month! Plus, Bathilda Bagshot is an historian, not a potioneer- why would she have exceptionally rare ingredients lying around? (Demiguise is what some invisibility cloaks are made of, Fantastic Beasts establishes their rarity and difficulty to hunt). Why not just make it a more common ingredient that reacts?</p>\n<p>9) Once everyone was back in 1981 near the end of the story, they assumed that Delphi was going to go murder Harry before Voldemort to prevent the curse from rebounding. Okay. But if that was her plan, how would she have found their house? Pettigrew never told her where it was so the Fidelius Charm would still be in place. Hermione never thought about that? What the hell?</p>\n<p>10) Where the hell did the second prophecy about Voldemort come from?! It’s also kind of cliché that there’s ANOTHER prophecy about Voldemort.</p>\n<p>11) Why wasn't Sirius mentioned as being at the Potters the night they were killed? He ought to have been there to give Hagrid his motorcycle!</p>\n<p>12) When Scorpius gets out of the lake and pretends he lost the Time Turner, Harry or anyone else could have said “Accio Time Turner!”, to get the Time Turner back! No need to drain the lake and the whole Delphi going back in time plot would’ve been prevented.</p>\n<p>13) When Albus and Scorpius come back from their first time travel, they ask Delphi what's changed. Now we've already established that by Prisoner of Azkaban time travel rules, nothing could be changed because it would have already been changed, but even if we were going by Back to the Future 2 time travel rules, Delphi couldn't have known what has changed because she would have changed too with the rest of the time stream. This happens a few times throughout their time jumps and it just doesn't make sense.</p>\n<p>14) At the time Scorpius, Delphi and Albus try to infiltrate the ministry and they make Polyjuice potion to imitate Hermione, Harry and Ron. How the hell did they get bits of off them to use them in the potion?</p>\n<p>15) Apparently Scorpius knows that Lily’s Patronus was a doe, but when Snape shows his Patronus Scorpius is surprised it’s the same as Lily’s. So he doesn’t know about that? And how would Scorpius know about Lily’s Patronus unless Albus told him about it? Didn’t Albus tell him the whole story? As I’ve said the characters seem to know way too much about their parents’ lives, but here is one inconsistency.</p>\n<p>16) That rumour about Scorpius being Voldemort’s son, because Draco went back in time to collect Voldy’s sperm? It’s the most ridiculous thing I ever heard. Where the hell did that rumour even come from? People only knew about the old Time Turners, the ones that go back 5 hours. So why would they create/believe such a rumour? They would know it’s not possible that Draco could go back so far in time with those Time Turners. The new Time Turners were only discovered later in the play and not a lot of people knew about them.</p>\n<p>17) How did Delphi learn to fly without a broomstick? Voldemort invented that spell/magic himself and he was the only one who could use it until he taught it to Snape, his right-hand man. Voldemort and Snape are both dead, so who taught it to her?</p>\n<p>18) Fake Moody was keeping a lookout at the Triwizard Tournament. He never saw Scorpius or Albus running around, especially in the maze, with his magical eye?</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27q\">Voldemort &amp; Bellatrix</h1>\n<p>1) Does anyone else realize that Bellatrix had to have been massively pregnant during some of the most crucial moments in Deathly Hallows? How did no one notice, how did no one know? Not even her sister? Or Draco?</p>\n<p>2) Why would Voldemort want an heir? He expected to live forever. He would be his own legacy, so he wouldn’t need a child. And the Voldemort I've always imagined would hate the idea of a child - he's incapable of love, and would never want to share power with someone else. Voldemort does not do love, intimacy or human relationships. Even if it is meaningless sex, I can't see him... in such close contact with, or holding anyone, get it? Argh. I can believe it if Voldemort had a baby when he was a handsome young lad, but as an adult, no, because - \"There wasn't enough human left in him\", remember?</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27r\">Acting out of character</h1>\n<p>1) Harry having suffered much abuse by his aunt and uncle tells his own child that he is unwanted? Just no. Harry, who had no friends growing up, forbids his son from seeing his only friend? Harry, who endured Umbridge's regime in book 5, imposes Umbridge-like surveillance on his son? Harry, who told Lupin off for wanting to abandon his own kid in Deathly Hallows, tells his son that he sometimes wishes he weren't his son?</p>\n<p>2) Harry: There's NO EXPLANATION for why his personality would be affected besides \"lol time travel\" and he's suddenly a horrifying, abusive, creepy father who goes completely off the deep end. Telling your son that he can't talk to his literal only friend? Grounding him to his room at boarding school? Having his headmistress (who apparently has nothing better to do) literally stalk his every move??? Rearrange the entire year's schedules so Slytherin and Gryffindor didn't have classes together??? Threatening McGonagall with the ministry?? He was a completely different person in the worst possible way.</p>\n<p>3) This is all because apparently Harry misinterprets advice from Dumbledore’s portrait in the worst way (because he’s that dumb in the play) and takes divination from centaurs seriously. Harry would never take divination from centaurs that seriously. He knows from following Divination that you rarely predict something real and Firenze told Harry’s class that divination from centaurs was often wrong as well. I didn’t see Harry freaking out in book 1 when the centaurs were predicting stuff.</p>\n<p>4) McGonagall: “Because far be it from me to doubt the wisdom of the centaurs…” Um, since when does McGonagall trust the wisdom of the centaurs? She thinks Divination is rubbish and that there are few true Seers out there.</p>\n<p>5) Something that amuses me about the play is that even going on 40, Harry still reacts to trouble the same as ever:</p>\n<p>Harry: \"The Malfoys are to blame!!!\"<br>Everyone: \"Harry no!\"<br>Harry: \"Harry YES!\"</p>\n<p>Some things never change... It's like her characters haven't evolved as real people and still keep the same character flaws as adults they had in their teens (according to the play writer).</p>\n<p>6) Albus and Scorpius are BFFs and Harry tries to separate the two. Harry and Draco do not like each other. I'm not sure that's even consistent with the end of Deathly Hallows and Harry's growth as a character in the original series. The epilogue shows Harry being civil and acknowledging Draco on platform 9 3/4. Harry himself had been through a lot and had had to learn to accept or trust people he didn't like (like Snape, whom he named his child after!). Now if he's got something against A CHILD, that just kills all of his previous character development.</p>\n<p>7) People believe that Draco's son is actually Voldemort's son because Draco went back in time for no other purpose but to collect Voldemort's sperm - by who-knows-WHAT means! And Harry, who's been a victim of gossip and rumour and ought to know it's bullshit by now... is the biggest dupe of all! It’s strange because in the beginning of the play he didn’t care about the rumours and then all of a sudden he does.</p>\n<p>8) Everyone still hating on Slytherin after 20 years. Albus being sorted into Slytherin and subsequently bullied to the point of despair despite the fact that it's 2016 and we know Houses aren't that one-dimensional anymore. Weren’t the houses going to be more tolerant of each other and change, compared to 20 years ago?</p>\n<p>9) Rose not being friends with Albus just because he’s in Slytherin. Rose Granger-Weasley being so incredibly ignorant that she straight-up shuts out her cousin and best friend FOR FOUR YEARS because God forbid he befriends a nerdy boy on the train on his first day at school. And I just can't imagine Hermione would raise a daughter who would ignore her cousin just because he was sorted into Slytherin. Not when she struggled in the past with Mudblood naming insults and fought so hard to free elves. Ron and Hermione would have raised Rose to accept Albus even if he was in Slytherin and to stick up for him.</p>\n<p>10) I can’t believe that Albus gets bullied and Rose ignores him for FOUR years and that no one has stepped in yet or tried to help Albus. Shouldn’t Harry and Ginny have helped Albus or asked what was wrong after a year or two? Okay, they did, but not enough in my opinion. Ron and Hermione should’ve reprimanded Rose already. What happened in family gatherings? How can Rose and Albus pretend to be civil to each other for four years except at Hogwarts? Someone should have noticed something. What about James? We don’t even see him in the play! He might have a laugh at Albus first because he was in Slytherin, but after a while he would have stood up for him I think.</p>\n<p>11) Ron was just being comedic relief without his depth he had in the books. Ron was funny in the books, but it wasn’t always because he was constantly spouting dumb jokes every few minutes. He had his serious moments. Now he acts like a dumb buffoon. Not knowing how to use Floo Powder and using his wand the wrong way? Ron isn’t that stupid. And Ron was so drunk at his wedding he doesn't even remember getting married?? He would never be that disrespectful. I don’t think he would ruin such an important moment in his life with Hermione.</p>\n<p>12) So Ron is just casually distributing love potions impetuously. After his experience with them, surely it'd be more characteristic of him to be apprehensive and not just flippantly give one to his best friend's son as a joke?</p>\n<p>13) That is not even fanfiction Snape. That is straight up someone else who had a personality transplant. A brave man yes, but a vindictive mean bully with emotional baggage such as bad childhood /obsession with dark arts/death eater/losing love of his life/playing spy/killing Dumbledore/losing the war with death of the one boy who he protected all his life? Now he suddenly has conversations and jokes with no sarcasm with Ron and Hermione??? Not even the tiniest bit similar. Just before Voldemort killed Snape in the normal timeline, he was still the same as ever. (Still doesn’t make sense how Snape’s alive now).</p>\n<p>14) Does anyone else feel like Snape's lines are too much out of character? Would he really say something like \"Tell Harry I'm proud his son bears my name\"? I don't think so. I also don't think he would ever say something as dramatic as \"I could not save Lily but I could help fight for the side she supported\", especially to Scorpius (whom he barely knows). That's just ridiculous.</p>\n<p>15) Hermione: They at least explained why she and Ron didn't get married, I guess, but I have an extremely hard time believing two best friends of many, many years only got together because Ron was jealous that one time. Just because of that one incident they don’t get together? Weird. I think they would’ve gotten together sooner or later regardless of that moment. Otherwise, it seems Ron and Hermione’s relationship was really shallow. (Which it isn’t in the books).</p>\n<p>16) And that scene with Hermione and Ron in the dark timeline - assuring themselves that they are still friends? This is the stuff of bad romcoms. But the idea that her not marrying Ron directly leads to her becoming Snape instead of Minister is infuriating. Her being literally so bitter about not getting together with him that she just picks up a job at Hogwarts where she can bully kids is the worst possible thing that could happen to my favourite character and one of the strongest, most well-developed female characters in literature. Hermione isn’t dependant on a man (Ron) for her happiness. She would’ve moved on eventually.</p>\n<p>17) Cedric being humiliated by a floating bubble head charm would not turn him into a death eater!!! He was a genuinely nice guy... There's just... there's no way. This goes against Cedric’s character: he was hardworking, loyal and kind. He wouldn’t turn into a Death Eater just because he was humiliated once or twice.</p>\n<p>18) It seems very strange to me that Mr Diggory asked Harry to bring Cedric back. He seemed to have accepted his death in book 4 and surely he knows that changing the past is an incredibly risky and dangerous thing to do? Mr Diggory worked for the Ministry, surely he knows that Time Turners are restricted for good reason?</p>\n<p>19) How come everyone in the Voldemort and Valor universe are totally cool with saying Voldemort? He's still alive in this universe right? SO why the hell is he suddenly cool with people using his name? Does he go by Tom, now? Ugh. Didn’t everyone who was afraid of him address him as You-Know-Who? The Death Eaters never addressed him by name; it was always “the Dark Lord”.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27s\">Minor plot holes</h1>\n<p>1) Even more importantly, how in god's name have no measures been put in place to counteract the threat of polyjuice impersonation? The woman who heads up the ministry broke into the ministry as a child with the help of its transformative properties. You'd think she of all people would be very much aware of the need for security policy that neutralizes that threat.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>More importantly still, why is her office door still able to open with Alohamora? I would expect more security for the minister’s office.</li>\n<li>Also wouldn’t the Time Turner be kept in the Department of Mysteries? That’s a much safer and secure place. At least McGonagall tells Hermione how stupid she is for keeping it in a bookcase in her office. Hermione is normally smarter than this.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>2) Scorpius knows the exact reactions of potion ingredients in his fourth year? Wouldn’t that be more for O.W.L. or N.E.W.T. levels?</p>\n<p>3) Harry leaves the ministry with the telephone box. But isn’t that the visitors entrance? As a regular employee, shouldn’t he be using the fireplaces or Disapparating?</p>\n<p>4) Harry knows Albus and Scorpius are in the Forbidden Forest because of some random dream he had, which is so convenient. He shouldn’t even know because normally his scar shouldn’t hurt anymore and if it did, he would be having dreams about Voldemort, not them.</p>\n<p>5) Didn’t anyone see Albus use Expelliarmus on Cedric? He was standing near Hermione and the crowd. Wouldn’t ministry wizards recognize that as a disarming spell from someone in the crowd?</p>\n<p>6) Scorpius and Albus wouldn’t be able to pass for Durmstrang students because they’re too young. The Durmstrang students were all seventeen or older, because otherwise they wouldn’t be able to put their names in the Goblet of Fire. Scorpius and Albus are only fourteen. They would look out of place.</p>\n<p>7) Okay, when Harry and Draco are duelling, Draco uses the spell Levicorpus. How would he know that spell? Harry discovered it in Snape’s potion book and he only told his friends about it. The spell was used during the time Snape, Sirius and James were at school, but then it went out of fashion. Maybe Snape taught it to Draco…</p>\n<p>8) I didn’t really understand the part where Albus and Scorpius get to the lake from Moaning Myrtle’s bathroom. How can they go through a sink to the lake? And is this the bathroom with the entrance to the Chamber of Secrets? Why would there be two sinks with two special entrances in one room? How did Albus get the gillyweed?</p>\n<p>9) Albus and Scorpius use an Engorgement Charm on Cedric in the lake, but then Cederic floats out of the water. Don’t Engorgement charms just make their subjects bigger? I don’t think they make their subjects float as well. Hagrid’s pumpkins and the spiders from Moody didn’t float away.</p>\n<p>10) The hedge apparently tries to dissect Albus and Scorpius in the maze. This the movie hedge. In book 4 the hedges don’t do anything. I thought the play was supposed to be a continuation of the books? Also, they shouldn’t be able to hear Ludo Bagman commentating, because the hedge in the books blocks out all the noise from outside the maze. Harry notices it when he steps into the maze.</p>\n<p>11) How can the Time Turner go from the 1995 Triwizard Tournament maze to 1981 Hogwarts? Every time the 5-minute limit was passed, the Time Turner returned to the present. Then you’d have the chance to go back in the past again. You can’t go from one moment in the past to another moment in the past.</p>\n<p>12) I know you can Transfigure parts of your appearance, but it’s a bit of a stretch to able to transform Harry into Voldemort. In Deathly Hallows, Hermione changed Ron’s hair and gave him a beard. You know, small stuff. But to change your whole body and the shape of your head, nose and eyes with Transfiguration? If that were possible, there would be no need for Polyjuice Potion! Also, wouldn’t Harry need Voldemort’s clothes?</p>\n<p>13) Why does Harry get disarmed so easily by Delphi? He can’t be such a pathetic fighter. He was the best in Defence against the Dark Arts and now he’s an Auror with multiple years of combat experience!</p>\n<p>14) Harry says to Delphi he never fought alone. Uh, yes he did sometimes. What about facing Quirrel, the Tom Riddle memory and Voldemort in the graveyard? Of course his friends helped him, but some things he did alone. He even starts yelling about all of it to Ron and Hermione in book 5, I believe.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1q0l8h27t\">Other stuff</h1>\n<p>1) Seems like no one is bringing up the fact that Albus snogged Hermione, while transformed as Ron, multiple times. Like full-on tongue? I wonder what her reaction would be if she found out? What would the whole family's reaction be?</p>\n<p>2) Anyone here who's a bit disappointed that they killed off Astoria, who seems like a genuinely good person that Draco loved very much? We didn’t get to see what she was like as a person.</p>\n<p>3) Is Harry's boggart a pigeon now? Since when has Harry been afraid of pigeons? They just threw a random pigeon arc in there. I don't recall a pigeon ever coming up in any of the original series. Maybe he was joking when he said that to Albus…</p>\n<p>4) Just because Delphi is Voldemort's daughter doesn't mean she had to automatically be loyal to him and be evil. Albus saying to Scorpius that Voldemort can’t have a kind son/daughter just doesn’t ring true. There have been many kind people in real life who have had bad parents. Delphi may have turned out to be kind as well, but she might have been brainwashed by the Rowles who are ex-Death Eaters.</p>\n<p>5) One pet peeve: What's up with them using \"Dumbledore\" the way we'd use \"God\"? It seems to have taken the place of the book phrases \"Merlin/Merlin's beard/Merlin's pants” etc. which are funny and make sense. But in my opinion saying \"Thank Dumbledore\" just sounds bizarre. Using “Potter” as a curse word in the dark timeline is equally strange.</p>\n<p>6) So there was still that weird scene where clearly Ron and Hermione are still in love or are supposed to be? Which would be sweet if he didn't have a wife (Padma) and a child but instead was just uncomfortable and inappropriate. As a side note, I do kind of want to see little Panju.</p>\n<p>7) The scenes from the books, like boarding the Hogwarts Express and Harry’s dreams are slightly different than the books. It’s not that important, but I’m just pointing it out.</p>\n<p>8) When Albus tries to get his broom to go up, it doesn’t work for him. But it’s strange that he’s the only one. In book 1 with Harry there were a few people whose broom just stayed on the ground. Everyone’s brooms going up except Albus’s is kind of exaggerated. He shouldn’t be the only one having trouble.</p>\n<p>9) The lines of Ludo Bagman and the audience at the Triwizard Tournament were so CHEESEY and awful. Ludo didn’t sound like himself with those dumb puns and comments. “Krazy Krum?” “Don’t hurt Cedric, Mr. Dragon!” Seriously?</p>\n<p>10) This is my opinion, but ‘engorgimpressed’ and ‘discombobulated’ are weird words to use in casual conversation. Also “Squeak, my geekiness is a-quivering?” No fourteen-year-old talks like that.</p>\n<p>11) Why would Albus need to eat chocolate after coming back from the past? He only broke his arm. Chocolate is for dementors. Madam Pomfrey would know that he wasn’t attacked by dementors. It just seems it was written in, because “hey, look, remember this from the Harry Potter books?”</p>\n<p>12) In the dark timeline Ron and Hermione don’t even attempt to fight off the dementors. Snape doesn’t try either. This really bugs me. Why don’t they do a Patronus Charm and then head back to the room under the Willow? Or everyone stays together and casts four Patronuses that circle around them while they walk to the lake. It seems that Ron, Hermione and Snape’s deaths were unneeded. If they’d gone down putting up a fight, it would be different…</p>\n<p>13) Why does Draco’s dad want a Time Turner, but he doesn’t want to use it? What if Theodore Nott decided after making the Time Turner: “hey, I’m going to use this ultra-powerful Time Turner for myself”?</p>\n<p> </p>",

The humans in the dome are encouraged to consume as much as possible and leave waste, because that helps the eco-system get going again. They dump the waste outside of the dome as you see in later episodes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ah\">Episode 3</h1>\n<p>-Vincent has a dream on the train. It’s actually Proxy One’s memories of Ergo deciding to leave Romdeau and of Proxy One firing all of the missiles to other domes. Just before Vincent wakes up Proxy One is seen leaving the train. He was there putting his memories into Vincent and watching over him.</p>\n<p>-Vincent follows Pino who is infected and knows the way out of Romdeau. The reason all Cogito-infected Autoreivs follow the same escape route is because that’s the <em>only</em> exit out of Romdeau. They want to escape because they know otherwise they’ll be hunted down and killed.</p>\n<p>-It’s possible Raul let someone kill Dorothy, Vincent’s Entourage, and was the one who framed him. He wants revenge against Vincent, because his family was killed by Monad. Raul uses this as a reason to catch Vincent and lock him up, but Vincent escapes outside instead.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ai\">Episodes 4, 5 and 6</h1>\n<p>-When Vincent falls out of the dome, he lands in the lake outside. You can see him underwater and Vincent also sees the underside of the wind ship, 400 Rabbits, that Hoody had hidden in the lake. Vincent is found by Hoody and has nightmares drifting in and out of consciousness.</p>\n<p>-People who escape out of the dome are infected with a virus. 80% of them don’t survive. Hoody managed to cure some of them with a vaccine, but he eventually ran out and couldn’t help anymore. The reason Vincent survived was because he was a Proxy. Re-l wasn’t so lucky and had to be taken back to Romdeau for treatment by Hoody. Note that Daedalus treats Re-l with Amrita cells (=Proxy cells). This foreshadows Re-l’s connection to Monad. Afterwards Re-l can walk outside without a suit, because she has been cured with Amrita cells and most likely got a vaccine as well so she is now immune to the virus.</p>\n<p>-Hoody is killed by Raul. It is revealed that one of the toy soldiers on the clock in the mall is missing. You can see that Hoody had that missing soldier in his house outside the dome, so he must have took it. Is this the reason he was thrown out of Romdeau?</p>\n<p>-Quinn is seen with her son Timothy. Perhaps Quinn used to be a high ranked citizen in Romdeau who was allowed to have a child like Raul. Remember the pseudo-humans can’t reproduce, so they need permission to receive a child from the artificial womb.</p>\n<p>-Hoody’s explanation about Proxies and what they can do all turns out to be true.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>They can change into human form: check.</li>\n<li>They can easily disappear at will: check (Because they move so fast, it looks like they disappear.)</li>\n<li>They can also enter humans and control their spirit: check (Bookstore Proxy, Proxy One and Senex are all examples of this).</li>\n<li>They can shoot lightning bolts/scorch the Earth: check (Kazkis shoots fire.)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hoody also says he’s seen Proxies with his own eyes. It makes you wonder who he is and how he knows all this.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61aj\">Episode 8</h1>\n<p>-We see for the first time that some Proxies can affect others’ subconscious just like Hoody said. Senex seems to have driven the woman in the cell crazy and and put her in an adoring, worship-like trance. The woman uses Senex’s actual name and what she represents. Other examples of this will follow in later episodes: Will B. Good with Pino and Proxy One with Vincent.</p>\n<p>-When Vincent and Pino fly over the warring domes, they are greeted by a blinding light, which is hinted to have something to do with Senex's awakening. Senex most likely was sleeping and was awakened by the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ just like Monad. However, when Senex awakens, she begins to kill off all the humans her dome that she encounters, reminiscent of Monad's killing spree in Romdeau. In the end, she is killed by Ergo Proxy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ak\">Episode 9</h1>\n<p>- Charos and Asura Domes are both linked through the romantic bonds between their respective Proxies, Senex and Kazkis. It appears that the two Proxies agreed to renew their vows after The Pulse of the Awakening but before they could Senex was killed by Ergo. Kazkis had long since killed the pseudo-humans in his dome Asura and was attacking Charos dome to wipe out the humans there.</p>\n<p>-Kazkis thinks Ergo has come to replace Senex, but when Vincent refuses and Kazkis realizes Vincent can’t remember killing Senx; Kazkis goes over the edge. He’s angry at Vincent/Ergo for acting like a coward and giving his memories to Monad who couldn’t take it. Kazkis considers Vincent a traitor among the Proxies for running away from his duties and Kazkis attacks him. He also wants to avenge Senex. Being the Agent of Light, Kazkis has the ability to shoot fire from his palms.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61al\">Episode 10</h1>\n<p>-Re-l’s not dead after all. Daedalus managed to heal her wound and hid her in an empty town on the outskirts of Romdeau dome. Meanwhile he filled out her death certificate and faked her death to everyone in Romdeau. Raul finds out the truth though.</p>\n<p>-Daedalus develops FP bullets based on Monad’s Amrita cells. These bullets have the ability to kill a Proxy. He gives two of them to Re-l and prepares a ship for her so she can search for Vincent and bring him back to Romdeau (and bring back a Proxy specimen).</p>\n<p>-Raul reveals to Daedalus that not he, but Donov Mayer ordered the attack on Re-l and Daedalus. People from Romdeau aren’t allowed to leave the dome and if they do, they may never come back. Daedalus let Re-l back in, so that’s why they were both punished. Donov makes no exceptions, even to his granddaughter.</p>\n<p>-Re-l has a dream about a childhood version of herself. The child Re-l encourages her to leave, but warns her as well. The little Re-l is not Real Mayer, because when Real Mayer is introduced to Raul in episode 18, she is much younger than little Re-l in Re-l’s dream. I believe this is the part of Monad inside of Re-l speaking to her for once. More proof is that little Re-l wears blue eye shadow at the end of the dream, something Real Mayer never did. Daedalus only decides to create another Re-l after he is abandoned by her in episode 13 when she follows Vincent.</p>\n<p>-The Autoreiv at the end of the episode who stopped delivering the paper may have gotten infected with the Cogito because of Iggy.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61am\">Episode 11</h1>\n<p>Vincent enters the City Lights Bookstore after losing Pino and the ship in the fog. The bookstore is owned by the Bookstore Proxy, the man Vincent meets. Here, the books are either filled with questions to do with Law or information regarding him as a way of getting his memories back.</p>\n<p>The similarity to City Lights Bookstore in San Francisco should be noted, as the \"owner\" or keeper of the books and memories wears a beret and snaps his fingers to trigger Vincent's memory. The owner also makes note of the fog surrounding the store, a weather trait San Francisco is well known for. Regarding these references or similarities, the Bookstore may have been near what remains of San Francisco.</p>\n<p>The bookstore is located in the ruins of a dome, possibly the Bookstore Proxy’s dome. The dome may have been one of the several destroyed when Proxy One launched his missiles to have vengeance against the space-humans.</p>\n<p>Anyway, every time the Bookstore Proxy snaps his fingers, we enter Vincent’s mind. There Ergo Proxy talks to him, trying to convince him that he and Vincent are one and the same. Vincent should accept he’s a Proxy, but he doesn’t want to.</p>\n<p>Actually it’s not Ergo talking to Vincent; it’s Proxy One. If you pay close attention, you’ll notice it’s Proxy One’s voice. Proxy One is working together with the Bookstore Proxy, influencing Vincent’s mind. Proxy One wants the Ergo side of Vincent back. He wants Ergo to forget about his human side. Vincent must accept he’s a Proxy and that he and Proxy One are the same. This is alluding to the fact that Vincent is a near copy of Proxy One. Proxy One wants Vincent to remember that, because it is important for the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’.</p>\n<p>The Bookstore Proxy meanwhile keeps bringing Vincent back to the present and then to his mind again by snapping his fingers. It’s also interesting that Vincent takes a trip along his memories of the past, with each person appearing with an Ergo Proxy-mask. Ergo/Proxy One comes with a nice statement. At the moment, he’s only observing the world, while not being any part of it. It’s also interesting that near the end of the episode, Re-l gets to be the one who loses her mask.</p>\n<p>At one point the Bookstore Proxy thinks Proxy One is going too far and intervenes. He thinks if Proxy One continues, it would be bad for Vincent’s mind. But Proxy One ignores him and continues with what he’s doing.</p>\n<p>At last the trial comes to an end for Vincent and he receives directions from the Bookstore Proxy to Pino and the ship, wondering what happened. This is when Re-l manages to catch up to them with her ship and finds Vincent.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61an\">Episodes 12 and 13</h1>\n<p>-Iggy was infected with the Cogito since episode 7, but he knew how to hide it until now.</p>\n<p>-Iggy loves Re-l but hates her at the same time, because the Cogito made him realize how much she ignored him. In the end he gives his life to save Re-l and Re-l realizes her mistakes at last.</p>\n<p>-This Cave Proxy was an example of a Proxy who had gone mad and had fled his dome or... maybe not. Iggy discovers some moss-covered things and realizes they were artificial wombs and that they are standing in the middle of a moss-covered dome. Iggy wonders if the Cave Proxy was the one who created all of this.</p>\n<p>-The Autoreiv with the brown skin accompanying him probably had the Cogito virus and that is why she protected her master. Also that is why she tried to kill Re-l after Re-l had killed the Proxy.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/hanne/Pictures/Saved%20Pictures/other%20anime/tumblr_mjsgy6lMpg1s8rdp2o1_500.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ao\">Episode 14</h1>\n<p>We have this Proxy who can change his appearance at will, and he keeps bothering Re-l, Vincent and Pino with this ability. Pino probably featured her best performance up till now.</p>\n<p>This episode is actually a whole flashback. The episode begins with a teaser of what happens at the end of the episode. Re-l philosophizes a bit. She believes that the world doesn’t end once she dies, though she used to believe this as a child. She’s a true realist. Then it seems that Vincent seems to have done something stupid, though he seems to blame Real and Pino for this.</p>\n<p>Flashback begins: We then switch to a lake, in which a dead Real is floating, with Vincent and Pino standing right next to her. The OP rolls, and we switch to Pino and Vincent doing some groceries. It seems that they ran into another abandoned city, Ophelia. This time, not even Autoreivs are active. Re-l walks around a bit, and gets some visions of Iggy. The city has a strange shape. Much like a huge crater entirely populated with houses and with a small lake and lots of trees in the middle. She walks around a bit, takes a look at the ship they travelled with and then she arrives at the lake. At that time, she could’ve sworn she saw something. That’s the first clue we get of the Proxy.</p>\n<p>Re-l then goes back to the supermarket, at which Vincent and Pino just finished shopping. While Pino has fun with cans, Re-l’s as cold as usual. Vincent wants to stay for a while, though Re-l scolds him, for not being determined. Then, Pino gets cuter than ever when she tries to present her own assembled meal to her. It looks absolutely disgusting. Re-l immediately turns this down and leaves, with the excuse of keeping a lookout. I don’t think the Proxy was at this scene. Both characters acted natural and said things that an outsider wasn’t supposed to know. (Like Re-l who drinks a lot of Ginger Ale and Vincent’s goal to reach Mosk).</p>\n<p>We then switch to Re-l, complaining about how Vincent and Pino bring her in a bad mood. Back to Vincent, he’s packing and runs into the Proxy, pretending to be Re-l, eating the pea soup from before. When he tells her to hurry, she tells him that she’s eating at the moment. Vincent gives her some ginger ale and then goes to get some water, along with Pino.</p>\n<p>Back to Re-l, the Proxy gives her a visit, pretending to be Vincent. He brings her the same ginger ale as he just got from the real Vincent. He then suggests staying here for a while. When you see this, and don’t know about the Proxy, the scene turns hilarious: first, Re-l tells Vincent to pack things up and leave as soon as possible. Vincent packs, but then he sees Re-l, taking it easy. Then Vincent comes back to Re-l, and he is the one again to suggest staying and Re-l is the one to suggest leaving fast. Still, when you know about the Proxy, this scene makes perfect sense. The Proxy is lonely, and he hopes for the two of them to stay.</p>\n<p>In any case, when the fake Vincent set up an incredibly fake speech, asking Re-l in a very sad tone whether she didn’t love him anymore, I began to suspect something. These feelings only got confirmed when the real Re-l pushed the fake Vincent off the roof of the supermarket, only for him to disappear into nothingness afterwards. The fact remains that the Proxy didn’t know about the two of them. He just thought that they were a couple with a child. He also thought they were still lovey-dovey, so that’s why he set up the act he did. He also let himself get pushed off, in order to try and test how Re-l would react to this.</p>\n<p>Vincent meanwhile managed to get enough water. Then he runs into the fake Re-l. She sets up an angry voice, and she asks for the Autoreiv. Then she attempts to kill Pino and Vincent locks her in a storage room. When he hears her reasons, it appears that Pino wanted to kill her. Vincent doubts this, of course, though he still asks Pino in a very kind way. Out of her explanation, it seems that Vincent believes that this was because of the food that Pino made. He indeed reckons that Re-l over exaggerated a bit. Meanwhile the Re-l Proxy escapes the storage room. What follows is the fake Re-l, falling off the roof of the supermarket, right in front of Vincent’s eyes. He then sees a figure on top of the roof, and heads there. While he does, he notices that the storage room from before is open again.</p>\n<p>When he gets to the top of the roof, the fake Re-l is gone, and the real Re-l appears behind him. She then asks him a few questions, which Vincent can’t answer and runs away. At this time, the Proxy must have captured Re-l. Pino, meanwhile, gets visited by the fake Vincent, carrying the real Re-l’s unconscious body. They head for the lake, and the fake Vincent drops the body of the real Re-l in the lake. It sinks, only to rise again. Pino then thinks that Re-l has died.</p>\n<p>When the real Vincent, meanwhile checks up on the Centzon (the ship they came with) he notices that it’s gone. He then thinks that Re-l and Pino left without him and that he’s alone again. He then notices that something’s happening at the lake. Back to Pino, she totally manages to pawn the Proxy when she unmasks him. Then, the fake Vincent attempts to strangle Pino, but then he sees that she’s an Autoreiv, who can’t be strangled. Still, when he acted as Re-l, he did mention the fact that Pino was an Autoreiv. What’s up with that?</p>\n<p>The real Vincent meanwhile arrives at the lake, and then he sees the fake Real, sinking into the lake. Vincent dives after her, and manages to save her. She then opens her eyes, and attempts to drown him.</p>\n<p>Pino meanwhile managed to save the real Re-l from drowning. The two of them realize that both of them aren’t the Proxy, though Re-l realizes that something’s happening. What follows are Vincent and the Proxy, floating in the depths of the lake and finding out about the facts that they both are Proxy. The Proxy then tells Vincent about his loneliness. Everywhere he appeared, people fled. Nobody acknowledged him. He then killed everyone in the city, in the hope of disappearing, though it didn’t work. He hopes to eliminate himself, along with Vincent. He then tries to break Vincent’s mind, in tricking him to die along with him.</p>\n<p>Vincent then surfaces, only to see the fake Re-l standing before him. She yells at him, and he realizes that she’s the fake one. This scene repeats for a while. During this, the fake Vincent also shows the bodies of all of the former citizens he killed, stored in the middle of the lake. I think this all happens in the head of the Proxy, as Vincent then sees the same scene of Re-l standing on the shore. He decides to go extreme by strangling her. Though then Pino comes to her. This makes Vincent think that he really killed the real Re-l, while in fact, they’re just standing on the other side of the lake, watching the two Vincents talk to each other. Re-l noted exceptionally well that the fake Vincent didn’t have a reflection in the water.</p>\n<p>Then, both of the Vincents sink again transforming into Ergo Proxy. What happened in the bottom of the lake is unknown. Did Vincent kill the shape shifter Proxy or not? Then, the real Vincent surfaces yet again, the same scene happens though this time, the fake Re-l is the real Re-l. We then switch to the ship again, where the episode started. Apparently, Vincent caught a cold after being in the lake for so long (you’d wonder why Re-l didn’t, as she also was dumped into the lake). The Proxy probably cut the ropes which were holding the Centzon at its place, so it drifted off. Vincent then managed to recover it. Vincent then relates himself to the Proxy. They were both lonely, though Pino and Re-l managed to save him. They managed to give his life meaning. We also see Re-l smile for one of the first times in the series.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ap\">Episode 15</h1>\n<p>-Vincent has to participate in a quiz show for his life. Most likely when they arrived at MCQ’s dome, Vincent and co were captured immediately. The host MCQ is a Proxy and has locked Re-l and Pino up. If Vincent wins, he and his friends live and MCQ dies, but if MCQ wins, Vincent will die instead.</p>\n<p>-Two very subtle hints that MCQ is a Proxy. He asks Vincent a question: “Ra, an Egyptian god is rumoured to have eyes <u>like us”</u> -meaning him and Vincent having blue Proxy eyes. Also at the end of the preview for episode 16, the game host’s eyes glow blue with energy.</p>\n<p>-MCQ knows that Vincent is Ergo Proxy. You also see that MCQ has won 25 times, which means he’s managed to kill 25 Proxies. It is unknown if there are still people in his dome or not. Probably not, since his audience exists out of Autoreivs.</p>\n<p>-The quiz reveals important plot points and facts like the Boomerang Star, Proxy Project and Proxy One. It seems Proxy One and Ergo Proxy are known among the Proxies. Kazkis, the Bookstore Proxy from episode 11 and MCQ seemed to know who Ergo is as well.</p>\n<p>-People on forums have pointed out that Vincent seems to look stupid, since he can’t answer simple questions in the beginning of the quiz. But realize why: Vincent isn’t a human who went to school and learned all those things. He is a Proxy and I don’t think Proxies really know about all that stuff (except for MCQ).</p>\n<p>-Meanwhile MCQ has managed to hack into the satellites and is broadcasting his quiz show to all the domes including Romdeau. Raul, Daedalus and Donov Mayer are able to see the quiz which is not good because: everyone knows Vincent is a Proxy now, Donov knows Re-l isn’t really dead, and Raul sees Vincent with Pino which infuriates him.</p>\n<p>-MCQ says he has an announcement at the end of the show for everyone. In the preview for episode 16 he reveals the coordinates of where Proxy One is. Proxy One is in Mosk (waiting for Vincent).</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61aq\">Episode 17</h1>\n<p>-In this episode you find out what became of the humans who couldn’t make it aboard the Boomerang Star and had to stay on Earth. Re-l, Vincent, and Pino come across the weird cave dwelling creatures. Re-l realizes from the cave drawings that the creatures give live birth. This means that the creatures were descendents of the original humans, who through live birth, became mutated by Earth's unliveable atmosphere. The cave creatures had to stay in the caves because they were so accustomed to the toxic gas inside, that they would die if they went outside. Yet, in the caves they were slowly dying as well from the gas. Some of the creatures tried to make it outside, but to no avail.</p>\n<p>-Before his brief removal from Director-General of the Citizen Security Bureau, Raul is manipulated by the phantom appearances of a smirking Vincent Law. Whether this image is merely a sign of his mental degradation, or Proxy One's own handiwork - is unknown. During this incident, he manages to break into the sealed off thermonuclear ICBM salvos, and launches one particular missile called \"Rapture\" towards the coordinates given by the Proxy host of the Quiz Show in episode 15. Believing that Vincent Law is there, the missile is intended to destroy him once and for all. However the Quiz Host did say this was the location of Proxy One, although Raul was unaware of the difference between either the carbon copy - Vincent Law, or his original persona - Proxy One.</p>\n<p>-It is revealed that Pino’s daddy was Raul, although there were some subtle hints given in the first three episodes.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61ar\">Episode 18</h1>\n<p>-Raul encounters Real Mayer, the second clone of Monad. Note the ball of red string Real is holding. The ball of thread is related to Ariadne from Greek mythology. There are many other things linked to ancient Greece in the series and I would include this one too.</p>\n<p>\"According to an Athenian version of the legend, Minos attacked Athens after his son was killed there. The Athenians asked for terms, and were required to sacrifice seven young men and seven maidens to the Minotaur every seven or nine years. One year, the sacrificial party included Theseus, the son of King Aegeus, who volunteered to come and kill the Minotaur. Ariadne fell in love at first sight, and helped him by giving him a sword and a ball of thread, so that he could find his way out of the Minotaur's labyrinth.\"</p>\n<p>I think Minos is Proxy One, Theseus is Ergo Proxy and Ariadne is Re-L/Monad. In fact, Real does use the ball of string as it is meant to be used - she drops the end and thus Daedalus finds her, while she also comments that she's done what he asked for (ie used the string to show him where she was).</p>\n<p>-Raul’s missile Rapture reaches Mosk and decimates the dome. Proxy One is indeed there and suppresses its effect to the point that the damage appears to have happened long ago, merely by \"hand waving\" the flames away. Then Vincent and Re-l arrive. Proxy One is seen standing in the ruins, tears running down his face.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61as\">Episode 19</h1>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/hanne/Pictures/Saved%20Pictures/other%20anime/Pino.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<p>The case is like this: we have a Proxy, in yet another dome. This one has created his own world: Smile World. It’s a world in which everyone keeps smiling continuously. But now, Vincent is approaching. In a last desperate attempt, he contacts Pino in a dream, in order to find out his weakness. Instead, she opens up his eyes with her smile.</p>\n<p>Pino starts out in the local garbage dump. Smile World is full of all sorts of fun attractions, though the unpopular ones get discarded. In the garbage dump, Pino meets up with two discarded cartoons: Al and Pull. They’re incredibly happy and carefree, even though they’ve been considered trash. An interesting note is that they’re actually Autoreivs. They then begin to make a wish, in order to get out of trouble: meet the creator of the world: Will B. Good, aka, the Proxy.</p>\n<p>Something very interesting is a poster, advertising a movie about the end of the world, in which Vincent in Ergo Proxy-mode is destroying a huge number of buildings. What if these prophecies actually have some truth into them? What if Vincent is destined to destroy the world? In any case, every Proxy seems to know Vincent, and his reputation.</p>\n<p>Then, a strange cricket appears. He’s very serious and goal-oriented, in contrast with the carefree Al and Pull. His name is Rogi, and he tries to get Pino to dump her new-found friends and take her to Will B. Good. This doesn’t really work. The foursome escapes from the garbage dump, which gets filled with water afterwards. Rogi gets annoyed by the care freeness of Al and Pure, as they seem to have changed their goals yet again: go to Will B. Good and find out the reason they were created. Interesting questions, coming from them. Their personality seems to clash with that of Rogi’s. He just can’t accept that there are people who live for the moment.</p>\n<p>Rogi then begins to ask Pino about Vince’s weaknesses, and she indeed reveals that she’s with some kind of Proxy. What happens afterwards is that Pino, Al and Pull discover the surface, and they get to see the amusement park of the Smile World. As they’ve got no tickets, they’re in trouble and some dogs with very large heads appear. Pino has great fun evading them in one of the attractions. While she does this, everyone begins to notice that she has an incredibly sincere and real smile. Something everyone in Smile World is lacking.</p>\n<p>Later, the foursome have been captured after all. Pino also mentions Raul for a moment while Al and Pull change their goals yet again: become real customers and have real smiles. They then get interrogated by the same guards as before. For some reason, the reason for the dogs to have such big heads is that they were wearing masks. In any case, the interrogators are so impressed by Pino’s smile that they forget their initial reasons.</p>\n<p>Rogi then loses his patience and sends them directly to Will B. Good. Will reveals that it’s extremely difficult to give people a constant smile. That’s why he needs total control, in order to protect this perfect smile. It’s ironic that all these smiles are fake. Each citizen of Smile World is ignorant about everything happening outside of the dome. That’s why they can remain “happy”.</p>\n<p>Will then starts asking Pino about Vincent’s weaknesses, and his treasure. He does this by putting up a fake smile. Pino knows Vince values his pendants, but she stays loyal to him and doesn’t tell Will anything. Will’s creations recognize the fakeness of his smile, after having seen Pino, and they turn against him. Will then resorts to his last option: beg Pino to stop Vincent. If Vincent and he meet, they’ll have to fight. When they fight, Will will lose, and everyone in Smile World will die. Including the friends Pino made. Pino then wakes up, and she manages to convince Vincent to stay away from Will.</p>\n<p>It’s a happy end, isn’t it? On the other hand, the citizens of Smile World still have all of their freedom taken away. They still know nothing. They still keep smiling forever, with a fake smile unless Will has learned something from Pino. It’s interesting to wonder what he’ll be doing afterwards. I don’t think we’ll ever get to see what happens with Smile World after this episode.</p>\n<p>Pino is shown to have grown during the episode. She can see lies, she’s loyal to her friends and she smiles like a real kid. She’s becoming more humanlike with the Cogito virus influencing her. Also as a robot <u>she is capable of having a dream</u> that Will B. Good sent her.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61at\">Episode 20</h1>\n<p>This episode is about a mysterious Proxy called Swan who invades Vincent’s dreams. Swan is most likely another attempt by Proxy One to destroy Vincent's love/dependence on Re-l (Re-l representing to Proxy One Vincent's desire to become human since Re-l is Monad made human) and force Vincent Law back into being Proxy One's agent of death, Ergo Proxy.</p>\n<p>Swan looks very much like a female version of Proxy One. Throughout the series, Proxy One has been manipulating events and people. Proxy One had a great hatred toward Monad since Monad took away his \"instrument of death against the progenitors\". Monad, because she loved Ergo Proxy, took his memories at the expense of her own sanity. This made Ergo Proxy useless to Proxy One and in spiteful revenge Proxy One has tormented Vincent in many ways forcing him to slowly return to being Ergo. Swan is another attempt at this.</p>\n<p>Proxy One probably follows Vincent and Re-l after they left Mosk and messes with Vincent’s mind like episode 11. During this dream Vincent’s fears are shown to us.</p>\n<p>-Vincent’s scared that Re-l will turn him in once they reach Romdeau and betray him. Proxy One wants Vincent not to trust Re-l.</p>\n<p>-Vincent’s also scared of becoming ‘someone else’ once he gets his memories back. He watches his ‘other self’, Ergo, through Re-l’s eyes. He’s afraid Ergo will hurt Re-l. Proxy One is warning to stay away from Re-l.</p>\n<p>-During the dream Swan asked Vincent to imagine the life he wished he had. Vincent was head of the Security Bureau with Raul his underling. Re-l was his girlfriend and Daedalus was her brother. However this is a wish never to come true. Proxy One/Swan probably wanted to see what Vincent/Ergo wished for the most. I don’t think it pleased him.</p>\n<p>-Proxy One wants the human side of Ergo gone. Swan lets Vincent think in his dream that he’s not real and just a figment of Re-l’s imagination, a split personality of Re-l. Swan even says that Ergo is the real one and that Vincent should eliminate himself from Re-l’s mind. To do this he must kill Re-l in his dream. (Proxy One wants Re-l gone too.) But Vincent is unable to do it. This is the moment he realizes that everything is a dream.</p>\n<p>-Then Swan brings out Ergo Proxy's pendant, given to Proxy One when Ergo Proxy gave up Romdeau to Proxy One and went to Mosk, and says angrily, \"How cruel. I never took it off, this charm of yours. I hate men who stink of another woman (Re-l). I'm sure she (Monad/Real) feels the same way.” This is when the dream ends and Vincent wakes up, feeling creeped out. It doesn’t help when Re-l asks if she can have Vincent’s pendant, which is exactly what happened in Vincent’s dream.</p>\n<p>After the dream, Proxy One returned to Romdeau, just before Vincent and Re-l do.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61au\">Episode 22</h1>\n<p>-Ergo Proxy entrusted Donov Mayer and the talking Greek statues (the Central Administration Bureau network) to take care of Romdeau. They had sworn to Ergo to keep the secret that he was the one who created Romdeau. That is why Donov remained mute for the entire series and never answered Re-l’s questions. After his death the statues were free of their oath and able to tell the truth to Re-l. The statues are Autoreivs by the way.</p>\n<p>-Look at Pino’s drawings. She used to only be able to copy others with drawings, but now she’s making up things herself and drawing them. More proof of how the Cogito keeps changing her. Pino’s become a “real” human child by now.</p>\n<p>-Kristeva finds Raul dead, trying to grab the drawing of him and Pino. She interprets this as her new mission: look after Pino for her dead master. She sets out to find Pino. By now Kristeva has also gotten infected with the Cogito. You can see it because she has red eyes.</p>\n<p>-Deadalus admits to having thrown away all the remaining FP bullets. Now no one can kill Ergo or Proxy One. Daedalus doesn’t care; he only wants Real beside him. Re-l is the only one with an FP bullet now, but she decides not to use it.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61av\">Episode 23</h1>\n<p>-Are there any survivors at Romdeau and the other domes? Yes, you can see some humans fleeing the dome at the beginning of episode 21. They will probably survive the air outside, because the sun is shining again and the Earth is starting to recover. I wonder what the space humans will do with them.</p>\n<p>-Daedalus and Monad flying toward the sun links back to the original Greek myth about Daedalus and Icarus. In ancient Greece, Daedalus was a famous architect, inventor and master craftsman. Daedalus and his son Icarus were locked up by king Minos. The two escaped and Daedalus realized they had to get away from Minos. However, as Minos controlled the sea around the area, Daedalus realized that the only way out was by air. To escape, Daedalus made wings for himself and Icarus, fashioned with feathers held together by wax.</p>\n<p>Daedalus warned his son not too fly too close to the sun, as it would melt his wings, and not too close to the sea, as it would dampen them and make it hard to fly. They successfully flew from the city Crete, but Icarus grew too careless because of the thrill of flying and flew too close to the sun. The wax holding his wings together melted and he plummeted to his death, drowning in the sea.</p>\n<p>The Daedalus in Ergo Proxy lies on the ground and warns Monad not to fly towards the sunlight, begging her to come back. Monad flies toward the sun anyway and disintegrates. Then Daedalus dies in the wreckage of Romdeau.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ir1nssd61b0\">Other stuff</h1>\n<p><strong><u>More on Pino and her name</u></strong></p>\n<p>Pino was purchased by Raul Creed and his wife as a replacement for a real child they did not have enough social privileges to be awarded (children in Romdeau are created in a lab and only a few of the upper citizens can get one). However, when Ergo Proxy starts, Raul Creed has been promoted high enough and the couple is awarded a baby. This makes Pino redundant and no longer wanted.</p>\n<p>Vincent Law is called upon to examine Pino due to a claim by the mother that Pino is corrupted with the Cogito Virus. Vincent sees the new baby carriage and recognizes that Creed's wife is looking for an excuse to return Pino for a refund and instead buy a \"housekeeper autoreiv that can also provide for educational and development needs.\" Creed's wife becomes defensive and angry when Vincent says he cannot authorize a return on a non-infected Autoreiv - but Vincent does not back down despite the threats of the wife using her husband's new authority against Vincent. Later in the mall, Pino does become infected by the Cogito virus, thanks to Monad.</p>\n<p>Throughout the series Pino develops human artistic talents from music to drawing, and she learns to create rather than imitate. That is her journey from machine to human - her Pinocchio journey. Also, her name, Pino, is an abbreviated version of Pinocchio.</p>\n<p><strong><u>“Cogito, Ergo Sum”</u></strong></p>\n<p>Most of the Ergo Proxy series is an examination of what it means to be human. The phrase \"Cogito, Ergo Sum\" (I think, therefore I am) is the basis of the entire series. The Cogito virus is named such because it causes the machines to be self aware and exhibit all the foibles and strengths of human emotion. This accounts for the different behaviours/reactions when the machines become human - they become as unique and distinct as a human. Also this is where Ergo Proxy’s name came from.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Raison d’être</u></strong></p>\n<p>French for Reason of being or Reason to live, this plays a prominent role in the Ergo Proxy series as well.</p>\n<p>In the domed city of Romdeau, humans and cybernetic constructs known as Autoreivs coexist to fulfill their purpose, or Raison d’être. Citizens are selected for whatever tasks best suit them, ranging from menial tasks to high paid government work, while their Autoreivs serve as companions or function as employment assets that supply whatever needs their masters requires of them. No one ventures beyond the dome into the bleak wastelands of the outside world, and Romdeau functions peacefully as the perfect model for obedient society.</p>\n<p>The show examines how one would react when losing their raison d’être, how people without a raison d’être/purpose to live search for one, and the aimlessness of citizens and Autoreivs who have no raison d’être.</p>\n<p>Vincent, Re-l and Pino search for a raison d’être during their journey. The Autoreivs infected with Cogito also search for a reason to live, having gained souls. Some can’t handle it and become aggressive. Daedalus’ raison d’être was Monad and Re-l. You can see how he goes nuts when he loses both of them. Iggy’s raison d’être was Re-l. He loses it when Re-l abandons him and tells him to go back to Romdeau. The statue Autoreivs in Donov’s throne room keep talking about raison d’être and how important it is for the city.</p>\n<p><strong><u>About Re-l</u></strong></p>\n<p>(This was a nice quote about Re-l that I found somewhere.)</p>\n<p>It’s funny when fandom calls Re-l a bitch because she’s everything but.</p>\n<p>She lives in a society where every errant thought is called a sin. You cannot think for yourself, lest you burden yourself or others. You cannot question. You must listen, be silent, and obey. Romdeau is a city of sheep with a dying and selfish shepherd leading the flock.</p>\n<p>Do you expect her to keep quiet, to live like a walking corpse?</p>\n<p>Re-l speaks. She thinks. She learns. She loves and she laughs and she hates and she breaks apart like a true human should be allowed to. She is flawed and perfect in tandem, torn between a world of gods and a world of humans, both imperfect.</p>\n<p>She wants to be loved. She does not want to be adored or put on a pedestal like Daedalus does. She wants the love that is promised to her, because an old man calls her family and treats her like a commodity, like bait, because that’s all she is to him. She wants to be heard, so she speaks out and questions, and yells. She investigates because she wants to know. She wants to be. She is no less important than Vincent and goes through the same story as him, just evolving in different ways.</p>\n<p>Re-l strikes against the grain. She is caustic, angry, demanding, and outwardly LOUD in everything she does. She wears black and makeup to draw attention to herself, to make a statement. She refuses to back down. She will not falter. And she will not be silent.</p>\n<p> </p>",

The apparent cause of this travesty was rapid climate change due to a string of explosions in methane hydrate reserves. Occurring during the second half of the 21st century, the impromptu detonations succeeded in wiping out 85% of the planet's (human) population.</p>\n<p>Some of the humans retreated to a giant spaceship (ark) in orbit called the Boomerang Star. There wasn't room for everybody - it was bad times for the ones that stayed behind.</p>\n<p>The retreating humans started Proxy Project (PP). They created 300 Proxies to take care of the place while they were out. The proxies contain an incredible amount of energy, and are capable of impressive feats of strength. They also contain Amrita Cells, which make them immortal. However, very specific, high-energy waves can destroy amrita cells. Proxies themselves can generate such waves, enabling them to kill each other. Proxies have another weakness - natural sunlight kills them. This is normally not a problem, since the world is shrouded in clouds and all the proxies live in domes anyhow.</p>\n<p>After being created, each proxy was tasked to build a dome with an artificial womb. With this womb they created humans to live inside of it. So there are 300 domes/towns, one for each Proxy. Each proxy was given creative freedom on how to create their dome societies. This was done to help create diversity among cultures and populations. Everything from idealistic post war 1950s America to Disneyland amusement (Smileland) to a Greek Philosophical City-State (Romdeau) was created. The womb made people, people made Autoreivs, and the combination of the two built some more in the domes and maintained order.</p>\n<p>Why create pseudo-humans, domes, proxies, etc at all? The domes were created to help get the eco system back in order and to provide a place where the space faring people could return. Human waste was encouraged in the domes to help start the cycle of the ecosystem again. The domes also were meant for genetic diversity. Both domes and space farers would repopulate the world once the methane gas dissipated and it was liveable again. It just took much longer than they calculated.</p>\n<p>Another reason is that should their space vessel fail, the human race would not go completely extinct. There would still be humans living in domes. This is also why the humans made the Cogito virus. If the space vessel fails and the humans in the domes also die out, they wanted some form of human intelligence/life to still exist. If there are no humans anymore, what would remain are human creations with souls of their own, if not entirely human on their own living in the domes (=infected Autoreivs). It would at least leave some form of life behind. Pino was pretty human at the end, and a cogito infected Autoreiv probably gets more and more human-like, the longer they survive.</p>\n<p>It is possible that the Cogito Virus is distributed and/or controlled by Proxies: AutoReivs of all kinds exhibit odd behaviour (prayerful postures, attacks on humans) in the presence of both Monad and Ergo Proxy. Indeed, following a close encounter with Monad Proxy in the Romdeau Shopping Mall, Pino appeared suddenly stricken by the same prayerful pose that afflicted other Autoreivs throughout the series. The praying position is most likely connected to humanity's singular desire to create/find a faith in a higher deity - unique among the animal kingdom and very distinctly human.</p>\n<p>The Proxies (hence the name) were created to care for and nurture the human population in the domes. The proxies realized after a while that their creations were imperfect: their humans couldn’t reproduce and were sterile. They were pseudo-humans and they could only produce via the artificial womb <u>which draws its power from the Proxy</u>. The Proxies realized that they had failed in their main objective: to keep the population safe. Since the humans lost the ability to breed, they were no longer useful (why Kazkis and many other Proxies destroyed their humans). This is the caged animal syndrome.</p>\n<p>What the Proxies didn’t realize was that the space-humans had done this <em>on purpose.</em> They had no plan whatsoever to breed with the humans in the domes once they returned from space. This is the final stage of Proxy Project. The humans in space want to make sure there's nothing on the ground when they finally come back to rebuild their civilization. Just nice, empty and useable domes ready for them to move in and live in. To such ends, they built a couple of flaws into the Proxies.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Proxies have souls/hearts. As a result over a very long time they start to get lonely, since each proxy lives by itself in a dome and has no real peers. Also realize when the story takes place, the Proxies have been living for at least 5000 years and some of them have long gone mad from living that long. These two things can cause a couple of different psychological problems:\n<ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\">\n<li><u>Aggressiveness</u>: Proxies become either self-destructive, or homicidal. Either way, the dome that depends on them is in trouble.</li>\n<li><u>Proxies can become escapist:</u> - they flee their domes and try to forget. This will also result in the dome dying because: No proxy -&gt; no working artificial womb -&gt; no more psuedo-humans.</li>\n<li><u>Proxies may seek out</u> other proxies to feel less lonely.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>Proxies are possibly programmed to kill other proxies. In addition to killing off potential resistance for when the space-humans return, this forces Proxies to always remain in isolation, adding to the loneliness factor. Each Proxy has its own dome which is its own territory or dominion, so if they encounter one another Proxies mostly act hostile and try to kill each other.</li>\n<li>Proxies die in sunlight. Once the planet recovers and the sun shines again, the proxies will no longer be able to live on it.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In conclusion the space-humans deliberately made the Proxies imperfect beings which means their creations will be imperfect as well, the sterile pseudo-humans. The space humans don’t want the domes to be full of pseudo-humans when they come back because there won’t be any room for them. They also don’t want super powered Proxies running around who could cause them problems. So they have a plan for both the pseudo-humans and the Proxies.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Pseudo-humans</u></strong></p>\n<p>Think of them as colonization of an otherwise uninhabitable planet, just like the moon. Those people were created as a slave/servant class to the \"real\" humans. These pseudo-people will die almost immediately from exposure to \"outside\" air, they can't procreate, etc. The reason for their entire existence was to maintain the domes. They were created to make these habitable colonies, maintain them, and then die off when \"real humans\" returned, leaving the \"real humans\" with places to live.</p>\n<p>Basically, the idea is to never have to go through the struggle of rebuilding towns and living with practically nothing. That's why, beyond the necessary minimal number of citizens needed to maintain order, all those \"empty towns\" were being maintained by robots constantly mowing and watering lawns, etc on the outskirts of Romdeau.</p>\n<p>We know that the species of humans put in the domes was already winding down through the fact that they had massive graveyards and almost no population to speak of, which gives further credence to the idea that it was all orchestrated and timed so that few to none would still be alive when \"real humans\" returned, but that they would \"go out\" peacefully.</p>\n<p><strong><u>Proxies</u></strong></p>\n<p>This is where the final stage of PP sets into motion. When the planet has recovered enough to become liveable again, the ‘<u>Pulse of the Awakening</u>’ starts for the Proxies. As a result the carefully programmed proxies are beginning to self-destruct. It's unclear whether the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ is something started in the proxies automatically in response to environmental factors, or if it's being broadcast from the ark in space, though the specific source is not important. Eventually the Proxies will die one by one and without them powering the artificial wombs the population of the pseudo-humans will decrease and eventually die out. The remaining Proxies will die in the sunlight. No Proxies and no pseudo-humans anymore. Problem solved for the space humans.</p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"file:///C:/Users/hanne/Pictures/Saved%20Pictures/other%20anime/Re-l.Mayer.full.308623.jpg\" data-is-external-image=\"true\"></p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ik2lserkj\">The Main Story part 1</h1>\n<p>The story takes place during the stage when the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ has just been activated. Five thousand years later in 7207, the story follows Re-l Mayer, Vincent Law, and Pino as they journey to find the truth that has been lost about their world and themselves. By this time, Earth has only worsened; a plague called the Cogito Virus spreads amongst the Autoreiv populations, the remaining Dome Cities are steadily failing, and Romdeau's regent, Donov Mayer, is naught but an ersatz ruler.</p>\n<p>We have Proxy One who discovers the truth behind Proxy Project and is enraged at the Creators. The Creator(s) is the name the Proxies call the original humans up in space, the ones who made them. Proxies think of them as god(s) and in turn the pseudo-humans think of the Proxies as gods or creators. Anyway the fact was that the Proxies including Proxy One loved their creations. However their human creations were merely a back-up copy of original humans in the event the Boomerang Project was unsuccessful. Aka Plan B. In the end it is clear that the Boomerang Project was a success, thus negating the need for the back-up copy of humans.</p>\n<p>This is what angered Proxy One: his creations were going to be wiped out and the Proxies killed once they’d fulfilled their purpose. He decided to punish the Creators and have vengeance. He planned the destruction of the liveable habitats (the domes), so the humans from space would have nothing to live in when they came back. Proxy One launched some rocket missiles and destroyed several domes.</p>\n<p>Another part of his plan was the creation of another Proxy, an Agent of Death to punish the creators for all the pain they had caused. This was Ergo Proxy of course, him being proxy 301. This was done by Proxy One combining his Amrita Cells with Monad Proxy, a female proxy who apparently fell in love with Proxy One. Instead of pregnancy occurring, the resulting Proxy was a perfect duplicate of Proxy One but instead he was given a mask to hide his face. This Proxy was also given the memories that tormented Proxy One when he learned of the true meaning of the Proxies existence and what their true roles were.</p>\n<p>It seems Ergo Proxy then reigned over Romdeau in place of Proxy One, but after some point Ergo Proxy saw himself as a failure, because he created imperfect humans but he still loved them. He renounces his dome ownership and appoints Donov Mayer to be Regent in his absence. He gives back Proxy One his pendant and travels to Mosk, the dome of Monad. Monad loves Ergo too, considering him a kind of son or perhaps another Proxy One. Ergo loves Monad as well, him being a near copy of Proxy One.</p>\n<p>Ergo doesn’t want to carry out his duty of death anymore and wants to live as a human. In Mosk, Monad and Ergo Proxy made an agreement to remove Ergo Proxy's memories so he could become human. Monad, because she loved Ergo Proxy, sacrificed herself in the process of removing Ergo's memories and creating the Vincent Law alter ego - putting her into a coma and destroying her mind. The memories were given to an Autoreiv, Amnesia, who was locked up in a special chamber that could only be opened by a Proxy pendant. Monad (Proxy 13) gives her own pendant to Ergo so he could one day open the chamber if he decided he wanted his memories back.</p>\n<p>Proxy One wasn’t pleased with Monad, having his Agent of Death snatched away and memory wiped. Meanwhile Donov Mayer, who loved Ergo Proxy, was sad and angered because Ergo Proxy abandoned him and the dome. Out of a sense of melancholy and revenge he decided to attack Mosk because he knew that was where Ergo had fled. Also since Proxies sustained the artificial womb, Donov decided to take Monad as a replacement because Ergo had left. Donov probably thought Ergo and Proxy One were the same person and never realized there were two of them and that Proxy One was still in Romdeau. So actually, Donov didn’t need to capture Monad for the womb because Proxy One was there.</p>\n<p>Anyway, the forces of Romdeau attack Mosk, destroying it. Proxy One does nothing to stop them, probably still angry at Monad. Monad is attacked on her throne. In her comatose condition, she was no longer able to protect the Mosk dome or herself. Monad’s body was retrieved from Mosk and brought back and locked up to replace Ergo. Daedalus reports that he was given charge of Monad Proxy when he was given the job of the Chief of the Health and Welfare Bureau; having the job of making sure that Monad remained unconscious and comatose.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Vincent Law, the Ergo Proxy alter ego, survives the bombings and is ushered back to Romdeau as an immigrant together with other Mosk citizens (unbeknownst to anyone in Romdeau except Proxy One).</p>\n<p>During the time that Monad is locked up, she is experimented on by the scientists of Romdeau which disfigures her greatly. You can see how Monad looks afterwards; she has a collar around her neck and is sewn up in various places on her body. It is unknown how Monad looked like before she was taken to Romdeau and experimented on.</p>\n<p>During this time, under the orders of Donov Mayer, Daedalus is created and once he is old enough, given the task to create a clone from Monad and look after it and evaluate its growth. This clone was supposed to draw Ergo Proxy back to Romdeau. The clone is given the name Re-l Mayer. But Re-l was an imperfect or partial clone of Monad. A combination of Donov’s DNA and Monad’s cells was probably used, thus giving Re-l a family connection to Donov Mayer. Re-l was told that Donov was her grandfather and grew up not knowing anything.</p>\n<h1 id=\"mcetoc_1ik2lserkk\">The Main Story part 2</h1>\n<p>Now we’re back in the present where the show begins. Because of the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ being activated, Monad woke up from her coma and she escaped from the Health and Welfare Bureau in an instinctive need to reunite with her beloved Ergo Proxy. Most of her mental capacities were destroyed when the Vincent Law persona was created - but clearly some of Monad remained, even in her diminished mental capacity.</p>\n<p>Along with many other Mosk citizens, Vincent applied for and received an immigration permit. While he was waiting in line for this, he saw Re-l Mayer for the first time and fell in love with her. Unknown to him, this was because she was a partial clone of Monad. She was present during his interview to enter Romdeau, and he later ran into her several times during her investigation of the Autoreivs infected by the Cogito Virus.</p>\n<p>Vincent meanwhile now works as an immigrant hoping to become a fellow citizen. His Disposal Unit job requires him to hunt down Cogito-infected AutoReivs in order to keep Fellow Citizens safe. In episode 1 Vincent drives back to where Re-l lives, because he unconsciously feels Monad closing in on him. Ergo wants to confront Monad personally, but is instead lured to Re-l who is another form of Monad. Vincent transforms into Ergo Proxy, who crashes into Re-l’s bathroom.</p>\n<p>Ergo seems fascinated by Re-l, not knowing that she is what Ergo wanted to become: a human without the Proxy side. Also Vincent is in love with her. Re-l feels fear but also a certain pull towards Ergo, which she later finds out is because she’s Monad’s clone. Monad meanwhile finds Ergo and Ergo defends himself and Re-l. Monad flees and Vincent is found unconscious near Re-l’s house, unable to remember what happened.</p>\n<p>In episode 2, Monad once again attempts to get to Vincent. Vincent is terrified and flees from her in the mall. Monad desperately follows, causing many deaths of citizens which were just collateral damage of her escape and single minded pursuit of Ergo Proxy/Vincent. At last she manages to corner Vincent who turns into Ergo Proxy and kills her, not remembering who she is. Monad dies with tears running down one side of her face.</p>\n<p>Raul Creed watched his wife and son get killed by Monad before his eyes. It is then that that Raul's sanity begins to crumble. He responds emotionlessly to the events. When Kristeva freezes the camera on Vincent, it becomes understood why Raul becomes almost illogically obsessed with Vincent Law. He will place the blame and emotion on Vincent for the events of the day of the mall massacre. His Autoreiv Pino also becomes infected with the Cogito virus, and flees the dome with Vincent.</p>\n<p>During all this, Proxy One realizes with the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ that he had run out of time to get his revenge on the Creators by destroying everything they left on Earth. He needed Ergo Proxy back as well. Vincent, Re-l and Pino make a journey to Mosk where Vincent believes the answers to his questions are. They encounter various domes and Proxies until they reach Mosk. (More details found in the episode guide).</p>\n<p>Proxy One eventually leaves Romdeau and manipulates the whole journey, trying to make Vincent accept he is a Proxy and make the Ergo side of him come back and forget about his humanness (Episode 11 and episode 20 for example). He also wants Re-l out of the way because she reminds Vincent of being human. An example of this is shown in episode 20.</p>\n<p>When Vincent, Re-l and Pino arrive in Mosk, Proxy One goes to the chamber where Amnesia is with Vincent’s memories. Proxy One doesn’t want Vincent regaining his memories just yet, because if he did at this point he wouldn’t want to cooperate with Proxy One and punish the creators as the Agent of Death. Amnesia thinks Proxy One is Ergo and offers to give him his memories, but Proxy One kills Amnesia and leaves his pendant around Amnesia’s neck.</p>\n<p>Later, Vincent and the others find the chamber and the second pendant with Amnesia telling them to go back to Romdeau. ‘Awakening’ is scrawled on the wall (by Proxy One to lure them back to Romdeau). They decide to go back to Romdeau to find out the truth once and for all.</p>\n<p>During the whole journey to and from Mosk, Daedalus is shown to have been obsessed with Re-l. He wanted her to himself and couldn’t take it when Re-l showed more interest in Vincent and followed him instead of coming back to Romdeau. He then created a fake Re-l as a replacement for the real Re-l. It is a true clone of Monad that includes Amrita cells and is growth-accelerated. The second clone is called Real Mayer who also gains Monad’s love for Ergo Proxy/Vincent Law. Real Mayer also has all of Monad’s memories.</p>\n<p>Raul also goes off the deep end, bent on killing Vincent. With Proxy One gone from the dome because he was manipulating Vincent’s journey, Romdeau dome begins to fail. Raul says that humans shouldn’t depend on Proxies and don’t need them. Raul wants to change the body of humans so they don’t need Proxies and starts with the ADW-project which Daedalus is in charge of. Daedalus has long since cracked-up and goes through with the project even though he knows it won’t succeed. Because of the project 90% of the population of the dome is killed. But Daedalus only cares about Re-l.</p>\n<p>Vincent, Re-l and Pino arrive at Romdeau. Vincent transforms into Ergo Proxy with Re-l searching for him in the crumbling city. Ergo Proxy sees Monad’s dead body in the lab and regrets killing her. He also meets Real. Meanwhile Proxy One goes to the throne room and strangles Donov Mayer in front of Re-l. Donov dies with tears running down his face, thinking he has been betrayed by Ergo Proxy. Proxy One is shot by Raul with an FP bullet but manages to live by tearing off his arm and growing a new one. He then leaves. Re-l also thinks Proxy One is Vincent at first, but realizes the truth when Ergo walks into the throne room and is surprised at seeing Donov dead. She realizes someone has been manipulating them in the shadows all along. Ergo has most of his memories back by now. Proxy One congratulates Re-l on figuring it out and lets Ergo and Re-l come to him.</p>\n<p>Re-l tries to stop Daedalus from destroying the dome while Ergo Proxy and Proxy One confront another and fight. Monad fully awakens in Real Mayer, her hair turning white and her eyes gold, just like Monad in Proxy form. She grows wings either made by Daedalus or because of her own power, and goes to Ergo Proxy. Real says that Ergo doesn’t need to carry out his mission and can come with her. Proxy One tries to stop her, but Ergo leaves with Monad.</p>\n<p>Real/Monad, says they can both leave the world behind and fly towards the sunlight. But Ergo realizes he’s run away long enough. He wants to face what comes and he wants to live for Re-l. Monad is sad to hear this and Ergo returns her pendant to her and leaves. Monad knows Ergo has probably decided to carry out his mission and he might do horrible things to the creators. She doesn’t want to witness this. Monad also sees that Ergo has chosen Re-l and her other love, Proxy One, is close to dying because of the wounds Ergo inflicted. She realizes she is not necessary anymore and chooses death, flying toward the sunlight and disintegrating.</p>\n<p>Proxy One is pleased Vincent has returned. He dies due to his wounds and the sunlight. Proxy One had explained that the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’ changes their form, making them vulnerable to dying under blue skies. Vincent kills Proxy 1, stopping his own pulse, making him immune to the ‘Pulse of the Awakening’. Ergo and Proxy 1 share the <u>same</u> pulse----\"I am you, and you are me\"----so by killing Proxy 1, he stopped the pulse, quoting Proxy 1 \"You stopped the pulse...dead.\" This is how Vincent is immune to sunlight unlike the other Proxies and able to confront the Creators. This was all Proxy One’s plan: he dies, knowing Vincent will confront the Creators like he had wanted him to.</p>\n<p>Meanwhile Re-l and Pino come to pick him up with the ship. Vincent stands on top of Romdeau looking at the spaceships from the Creators returning. Vincent has no split-personality anymore; he and Ergo have merged together into one person. Vincent looks at the ships with blue eyes stating he is Ergo Proxy, the Agent of Death. And that’s how the story ends.</p>\n<p>Who knows what Vincent will do? The ending is left up to the interpretation of the viewer. The space-humans will be in for a big surprise when they realize there’s still a Proxy around and most of the domes have been decimated. Will he attack the space-humans or will Re-l and Pino be able to stop him? Vincent’s normally not a violent person so he might not attack immediately but I’m sure even he would like to ‘have a word’ with the Creators for everything they did. He might attack only if he is provoked by them. Luckily Re-l and Pino will be there to help him. I believe Vincent has also finally found his true self, who he is. He also wants to heal the world and live to experience life with Pino and Re-l (another reason he chose not to fly into the sunlight with Monad/Real.)</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p> </p>",
